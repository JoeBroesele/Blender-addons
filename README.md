# Blender Add-Ons

Collection of useful add-ons for the 3D computer graphics software
[Blender](https://www.blender.org/).



## Installation

* Copy the files in the folder ```addons``` into the folder
  ```scripts/addons``` of your Blender installation.
* Alternatively, open Blender and click ```Edit``` -> ```Preferences...``` ->
  ```File Paths```. Then set the path for ```Scritps``` to point to this
  directory (that contains the ```addons``` directory).
* Enable the new add-ons in Blender by clicking ```Edit``` ->
  ```Preferences...``` -> ```Add-ons```. Then check the add-ons that you like
  to enable, e.g. ```Object: Newton's Cradle```.

* Expand the properties panel of the ```Newton's Cradle``` object and adjust
  the settings as desired.
